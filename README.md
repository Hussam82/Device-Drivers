# Device Drivers
This repository contains a collection of device drivers written in C. The drivers are intended for use with the Linux kernel.

# Installation
To install the device drivers, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Hussam82/Device-Drivers.git
Then, navigate to the cloned directory and run the following command:

make
This will compile the drivers and generate the necessary kernel modules.

# Usage
To use the device drivers, load the kernel modules into the running kernel using the insmod command. For example:

sudo insmod mydriver.ko
Once the module is loaded, you can interact with the device using standard system calls such as open(), read(), write(), and close().
